This project is a working simulation of DNS servers written in java and implemented in object orientation.
DNS servers are organized into Root Server, Secondary Servers and Authoritative Servers.
In addition, the end user has a local cache memory that stores some accessed addresses.
Classes are built using techniques of inheritance between classes and encapsulation of methods and variables.
